		<h1 class="hero-headline">First City of the New World</h1>
		<div class="row">
		<div class="columns_2"><p class="intro-body">First permanent establishment of the « New World » and capital of the West Indies,the Colonial City of Santo Domingo – the only one of the 15th century in the Americas – was the place of departure for the spread of European culture and the conquest of the continent. From its port conquerors such as Ponce de Leon, Juan de Esquivel, Herman Cortes, Vasco Núñez de Balboa, Alonso de Ojeda and many others departed in search of new lands.<br/>

		Located at the mouth of the Ozama, on the south coast of Hispaniola Island, the Colonial City of Santo Domingo is the core from which Santo Domingo de Guzman, capital of the Dominican Republic, was founded. Originally established on the east side of the Ozama in 1496, it was founded by Bartholomew Columbus in 1498, by order of the Catholic kings.  In 1502, the Governor Nicolas de Ovando transferred its institutions to the west bank and decided to provide the city with a grid pattern from the Grand Place (Plaza Mayor). This checkerboard layout later became a reference for almost all the town planners of the New World.
 </p></div>
		
		<div class="columns_2"><p class="intro-body">Over an area of 106 ha, bordered by walls, bastions and forts, the inscribed site comprises 32 streets that criss-cross the 116 blocks, constructions of one or two levels with stone, brick or earthen walls.  With its monumental heritage ensemble and its Gothic buildings unique in this region of the continent, the Colonial City of Santo Domingo maintains in essence the structure, use and functions that have characterized the first constructions at the time of its foundation, preserving its integrity and authenticity. <br/>

		City of encounters, it is here where for the first time native, European and African  cultures crossed and where multicultural understanding was developed in  total synchronization of knowledge, language, belief and experiences. Also, it is the Colonial City of Santo Domingo where the Dominican monk, Brother Antonio Montesino launched his appeal for the natural right of the natives, marking the beginning of the combat for the fundamental rights of mankind.  </p></div>

		<p class="mon-body">One of the great monuments that distinguish East Santo Domingo is theColumbus Lighthouse El Faro a Colón. The idea for the monument honoring the discoverer of America, Columbus, was started by Dominican writer Antonio del Monte and Tejada, according to his book “Historia de Santo Domingo”.

		This monument is located on the avenue Avenida Boulevard del Faro, in Villa Duarte. In 1914, William Ellis, of North American origin, promoted the statue’s erection event in Santo Domingo before U.S. press officials; in 1923 the idea of the lighthouse became a reality during the 5th International American Conference, a place where it was cooperatively agreed to begin construction. </p></div>

		<div class="mon2"><h3>The Cathedral of Santa María la Menor </h3></div>
		<p class="mon-body">The city of Santo Domingo and the Cathedral of Santa Maria La Menor is honored throughout the Americas as the birthplace of Christianity in the New World.  Although a Catholic site, it also predated any significant Protestant settlements in the Americas by many years.  For a while the city of Santo Domingo served as the headquarters of the Catholic Church in the New World, and the Cathedral its chief place of worship.
			
		For many years the Cathedral also had the added attraction of the Tomb of Christopher Columbus.  Santa Maria La Menor remains to this day the most important Christian shrine in the Caribbean, and is an all-but-mandatory pilgrimage stop for Christian tourists to the island.  The Cathedral of Santa Maria La Menor is part of the Colonial City of Santo Domingo UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p></div>

			<p class="mon-body">The National Pantheon changed into constructed from 1714-1746 by way of the Spaniard Geronimo Quezada y Garçon and became originally a Jesuit church. The structure was built in the neoclassic-renaissance style. Today, the shape stands as a national symbol of the Dominican Republic and serves as the final resting location of the Republic’s most honored residents. 

			Jesuits held mass here till 1767. After 1767, it became used as a tobacco warehouse and then as the first Dominican theater for only inventive functions with the aid of the society Amantes de las Letras in 1860 till 1878 whilst it became theater La Republicana which operated till 1917.</p></div>

		<div class="mon4"><h3>Columbus Alcazar</h3></div>
		<p class="mon-body">The Alcázar is one of the most relevant spots in the Ciudad Colonial and the first fortified palace in the New World. Don Diego Columbus commanded the construction of his new residence; for that purpose he used Spanish builders in charge of 1,500 indigenous people. The structure, made up of coral rocks, was built between 1510 and 1514 following a design that mixed Spanish and Italian Renaissance, Gothic and Mudejar styles.

		The residence has been used as a home for the Columbus family of Toledo until approximately 1577. In 1586, the fearsome pirate Francis Drake invaded the city, and it seems he took an important number of valued treasures located in the Alcázar. </p></div>

		<div><p class="cul-body">The island’s natives, the Taíno tribe, have passed down some of their own words and foods. Origins of the words for hammock and tobacco, for example, can be traced to the native Arawak language of the island. Similarly, local foods and agriculture form the basis of the current mix of culinary styles.</p></div>
		
		<div class="row">
		<div class="columns_2"><p class="cul-body2">Native crafts are extremely important as cultural expressions, and many vacationers choose to bring home these crafts as souvenirs. Mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) rocking chairs are extremely popular, but other notable crafts are made from horn, snail, shell, wood, leather, amber, and larimar materials. Pottery/ceramics, basketry, embroidery, and locally manufactured cottons are also popular.

		Art is another popular cultural item. In spite of the many blights perpetrated by the dictator Trujillo, his fondness for painting did encourage the art community on the island. In fact, the Dominican Republic is home to an art school as well as a museum of modern art. Architecture is another important cultural aspect. As the new world’s first European city, architecture lovers will find many sites to explore.

 </p></div>
		
		<div class="columns_2"><p class="cul-body">Merengue is the most popular form of music in the Dominican Republic, but bachata is the music of the rural country folk of the island. Salsa is another important musical form, filling out what is sometimes referred to as the trinity of island music. Music, however, is noticeably one of the most important components of Dominican culture.

		Local instruments help Dominican music stand out as a unique cultural form. The güira is a rhythmic instrument, which is made of a cylindrical brass grater. The güira, a scraped-out gourd, is rasped rhythmically with a fork. Tambora is a type of drum with the skin of a male goat tempered with rum on one side, and the skin of a female goat that has not given birth on the other side. Perico ripiao is a three-person interpretation of this vernacular music.  </p></div>

UNESCO stands up for freedom of expression, as a fundamental right and a key condition for democracy and development. Serving as a laboratory of ideas, UNESCO helps countries adopt international standards and manages programmes that foster the free flow of ideas and knowledge sharing.<br>

			UNESCO’s founding vision was born in response to a world war that was marked by racist and anti-Semitic violence. Seventy years on and many liberation struggles later, UNESCO’s mandate is as relevant as ever. Cultural diversity is under attack and new forms of intolerance, rejection of scientific facts and threats to freedom of expression challenge peace and human rights. In response, UNESCO’s duty remains to reaffirm the humanist missions of education, science and culture. </p></div>
